        <h2>Week Two Final App Project Write-up: Requirements</h2>
        <h2>Version 0.2.0 - Initial</h2>
        <p>
          As mentioned during Week 1, you need to be working on an Ionic app as your final 
          project for this course.<br> 
          The app doesn't have to be very fancy. <br>
          It should serve as a demonstration of the concepts we learned during the course.<br>
          More importantly, I would like this app to be something that you can expand or 
          use in real life after you have completed this course.<br> 
          <br>
          It's *OK* to build another chat app or tweet app. But, ask yourself, do you really 
          want to re-invent the wheel?<br>
          <br>
          Here are some of the things to keep in mind that are requirements for this app:<br>
          <br>
          1. Yes, it needs to be an Ionic app. Preferably, it will be tested on real mobile device 
          (iOS or Android).<br> 
          &emsp; If you can't get hold of a device, that's OK.<br>
          <br> 
          2. It should use at least one of the Cordova Native plugins found on 
          https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/Links to an external site..<br>
          <br>
          3. Preferably, the app also uses MongoDB. If it is not relevant to your app, that's OK.<br>
          <br>
          4. It's also preferable to utilize Heroku service.<br> 
          &emsp; Again, if it is not an option, that's fine too.<br>
          <br>
          5. If you cannot implement all the features that you envisioned for this app by end of 
          the week 8, that is perfectly fine.<br> 
          &emsp; But, please give some documentation of what you implemented and what you couldn't.<br>
          &emsp; And, share if you have some plans to implement in the future.<br> 
          <br> 
          6. Final course app should be submitted into GitHub repository using GitHub Classroom.<br> 
          &emsp; This is the link to the Final app assignment:<br> 
          &emsp; https://classroom.github.com/a/vl9UEny0<br>
          <br>
          <b>Note: Please push the code you started on the final app as often as possible to allow 
          for the instructor to review the work you are doing along the way.</b><br>
        </p>

        <h2>Week Two Final App Project Write Up: Rubric</h2>
        <p>
          1. Topic Choice: Ionic App proposed topic is original and feasible.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          2. Proposed App Meets Criteria: Ionic app will use a Cordova native plugin, Mongo DB 
             and/or Heroku, and includes plans for specific, implementable features.<br>   
        </p>

          and or staff that may evaluate, process and prioritization,<br>
          and investment board decision makers who provide award/grant. This app would include simple functions
          (proposal form submission), dashboard status display,<br>
          and complex task (proposal evaluation, prioritization, scoring, selection for award/grant).
        </p><br>
