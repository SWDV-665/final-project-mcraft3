            Week Two Final App Project Write-up: Requirements<br>
            Version 0.2.0 - Initial
          </ion-card-header>
          <ion-card-content>
            <!-- Add card content here! -->
              As mentioned during Week 1, you need to be working on an Ionic app as your final 
              project for this course.<br> 
              The app doesn't have to be very fancy. <br>
              It should serve as a demonstration of the concepts we learned during the course.<br>
              More importantly, I would like this app to be something that you can expand or 
              use in real life after you have completed this course.<br> 
              <br>
              It's *OK* to build another chat app or tweet app. But, ask yourself, do you really 
              want to re-invent the wheel?<br>
              <br>
              Here are some of the things to keep in mind that are requirements for this app:<br>
              <br>
              1. Yes, it needs to be an Ionic app. Preferably, it will be tested on real mobile device 
              (iOS or Android).<br> 
              If you can't get hold of a device, that's OK.<br>
              <br> 
              2. It should use at least one of the Cordova Native plugins found on 
              https://ionicframework.com/docs/native/Links to an external site..<br>
              <br>
              3. Preferably, the app also uses MongoDB. If it is not relevant to your app, that's OK.<br>
              <br>
              4. It's also preferable to utilize Heroku service.<br> 
              Again, if it is not an option, that's fine too.<br>
              <br>
              5. If you cannot implement all the features that you envisioned for this app by end of 
              the week 8, that is perfectly fine.<br> 
              But, please give some documentation of what you implemented and what you couldn't.<br>
              And, share if you have some plans to implement in the future.<br> 
              <br> 
              6. Final course app should be submitted into GitHub repository using GitHub Classroom.<br> 
              This is the link to the Final app assignment:<br> 
              https://classroom.github.com/a/vl9UEny0<br>
              <br>
              <b>Note: Please push the code you started on the final app as often as possible to allow 
              for the instructor to review the work you are doing along the way.</b><br>

            1. Topic Choice: Ionic App proposed topic is original and feasible.<br>
            <br>
            2. Proposed App Meets Criteria: Ionic app will use a Cordova native plugin, Mongo DB 
            and/or Heroku, and includes plans for specific, implementable features.<br>

            1. Corporate Project Proposals provides a Resource for Management of Internal Research 
            & Development (IRaD), Sustainment, Lab Revitalization & Maintenance, Capital Investments, 
            Innovation, Ideation, and Change Mangement!<br> 
            <br>
            2. Storyboard: CPP will provide an app for submitting proposals for internal corporate 
            infrastructure improvements to support work conducted by the organization.<br>

            CPP will support three main use cases & personas, end users for proposal submission, middle 
            management and or staff that may evaluate, process and prioritization, and investment board 
            decision makers who provide award/grant. This app would include simple functions (proposal 
            form submission), dashboard status display, and complex task (proposal evaluation, 
            prioritization, scoring, selection for award/grant).<br>
            <br>
            3. Proposals may include sustainment, revitalization, and maintenance, or establishment 
            of a new facility or capability.<br>
